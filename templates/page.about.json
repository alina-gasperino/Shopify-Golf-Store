All products are skillfully designed by Rick, our founder and CEO, who started making training aids out of PVC pipes to improve his golf skills. Over the years as inventions started to pile up and people encouraged him to make some for them, he decided to partner with his son Sam to start improving and mass producing the ideas. With his engineering background, multiple 3D printers, and countless hours, Rick started creating prototypes and Islands Golf was born.<\/p>"
